"This ancient and mysterious charm conjures a magical guardian, a projection of all your most positive feelings.
The Patronus Charm is difficult, and many witches and wizards are unable to produce a full, corporeal Patronus, a guardian which generally takes the shape of the animal with whom they share the deepest affinity.
You may suspect, but you will never truly know what form your Patronus will take until you succeed in conjuring it."
â€” Miranda Goshawk's overview of the Patronus Charm[src]
